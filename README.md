# Alzheimer's-Disease-Target-Database
This project aims at providing Alzheimer's disease target database which is ready for inverse virtual screening (inverse docking).

#ad_target.tar.gz
This file contains 540 folders named with a 4-letter-PDB code. Each folder contains three files: ligand.mol2, protein.mol2 and receptor.oeb.gz.

protein.mol2: protein structure extracted from the PDB structure;
ligand.mol2:  the cognated ligand extracted from the PDB structure;
receptor.oeb.gz: receptor file ready for OEDocking

#ad_target_annotation.txt
Annotation for the target database
